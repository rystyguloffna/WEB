        <p>Steeped in traditional culture, South Korea shows off its history and heritage proudly.  Home to 11 UNESCO World Heritage sites that include temples, palaces and fortresses in cities like Seoul, Gyeonggi and Jeju, learn all about the country’s imperial past. On your list of places to visit should be Haeinsa Temple, Jongmyo Shrine and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty. <br><br>
        <strong>Food Feast</strong><br>
        Like in India, food plays a big role in the daily life of South Koreans and with good reason! Korean food is absolutely delicious. Rice, vegetables and meats are most often used in preparing a variety of regional dishes like kimchi, gimbap and japchae, to name a few. Street food is very popular across South Korea and at stalls scattered all over, you can sample freshly made vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. <br>
        <strong>Café Culture</strong><br>
        South Koreans LOVE their coffee! The café culture in the country is booming with a multitude of cafes, both local and international branded chains, offering a hot cup of brew anytime you’d like. More than just coffee, the cafés serve as great meeting places for the young and old. In addition to socializing, cafés are also where many South Koreans set up their virtual offices and put in a day’s work!.</p>
